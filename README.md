# LoanPredictionProblem_NaiveBayes
Naive Bayes algorithm is applied to the Loan Prediction Data set by first considering all the categorical variables and converting them to dummy variables. with default probability cut off specificity for the model was very high so I haven't tuned the probability cut off in this model. Then the model was applied to the test data.
